Forget is a post deleting service for Twitter, Mastodon, and Misskey.

You can run a copy of it on your server, or use the server run by the
maintainer at <https://forget.codl.fr/>


## Features

  * Delete your posts when they cross an age threshold.
  * Or keep your post count in check, deleting old posts when you go over.
  * Preserve old posts that matter by giving them a favourite or a reaction.
  * Set it and <i>forget</i> it. Forget works continuously in the background.

## Non-features

Forget is not a one-time purging tool. It is designed to prune your account
continuously, not quickly. If you need a lot of posts gone fast, you may want
to look for another more-suited tool.

## Running your own

### Requirements

* Postgresql
* Redis
* Python 3.6+
* Node.js 10+


### Set up venv

Setting up a venv will isolate Forget from your system's libraries and allow you to install
dependencies locally as a normal user. It's not necessary but it is recommended!

```
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

If you're using `zsh` or `fish` as a shell, substitute `venv/bin/activate` with
`venv/bin/activate.zsh` or `venv/bin/activate.fish`, respectively.

You will need to "activate" the venv in every new terminal before you can use
pip or any python tools included in dependencies (honcho, flask...)

### Download and install dependencies

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ npm install
```

Wow!! Exciting

### Create and complete config file

Gotta set up those, paths, and stuff.

```
$ cp config.example.py config.py
$ $EDITOR config.py
```

### Set up database schema

If you haven't started postgresql yet now would be a great time to do that.

```
$ createdb forget # if you havent created the DB yet
$ env FLASK_APP=forget.py flask db upgrade
```

### Build static assets

Gonna do it...!

```
$ doit
```

Done did it.

### Running

The included `Procfile` will run the app server and the background worker.
`honcho`, a `Procfile` runner, is included as a dependency:

```
$ honcho start
```

The application server will listen on `http://127.0.0.1:42157`.
You'll want to use your favourite web server to proxy traffic to it.

### Development

For development, you may want to use `Procfile.dev`, which starts flask in
debug mode and rebuilds the static assets automatically when they change

```
$ honcho -f Procfile.dev start
```

Or you could just look at `Procfile.dev` and run those things manually. It's up
to you.

You can run the (currently very incomplete) test suite by running `pytest`.
You'll need redis installed on your development machine, a temporary redis
server will be started and shut down automatically by the test suite.

## Docker

This project is also able to be deployed through Docker.

1. Copy `docker-compose.yml` and `config.docker.py` into your preferred
   directory.
1. Rename `config.docker.py` to `config.py` and add additional configurations to
   your liking.
1. By default, the `docker-compose.yml` creates relative mounts `./redis`,
   `./postgres`, and `./celery` relative to the `docker-compose.yml` location.
   Feel free to change these if you'd like.
1. Run `docker-compose up` to start or `docker-compose up -d` to start in the
   background, and use `docker-compose down` to stop.
1. If you have a reverse proxy on a docker network already, simply add the
   Docker network details to `docker-compose.yml` and Forget should be available
   at `http://forget:42157` in the Docker network. Otherwise, you'll need to add
   something like the following to bind the docker container to a port:
   ```
   services:
     forget:
       ...lots of stuff...
       ports:
         - "127.0.0.1:42157:42157"
       ...other stuff...
   ```
   This will bind the container's port `42157` to `127.0.0.1:42157` on your
   local machine, which you can then reverse proxy. Make sure to never expose
   this publically, as it is http and not secure!
