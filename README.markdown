Forget is a post deleting service for Twitter and Mastodon. It lives at
<https://forget.codl.fr>.


## Running your own

### Requirements

* Postgresql
* Redis
* Python 3.6+
* Node.js 10+
* NPM


### Set up venv

Setting up a venv will isolate Forget from your system's libraries and allow you to install
dependencies locally as a normal user. It's not necessary but it is recommended!

```
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

If you're using `zsh` or `fish` as a shell, substitute `venv/bin/activate` with
`venv/bin/activate.zsh` or `venv/bin/activate.fish`, respectively.

You will need to "activate" the venv in every new terminal before you can use
pip or any python tools included in dependencies (honcho, flask...)

### Download and install dependencies

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ npm install
```

Wow!! Exciting

### Create and complete config file

Gotta set up those, paths, and stuff.

```
$ cp config.example.py config.py
$ $EDITOR config.py
```

### Set up database schema

If you haven't started postgresql yet now would be a great time to do that.

```
$ createdb forget # if you havent created the DB yet
$ env FLASK_APP=forget.py flask db upgrade
```

### Build static assets

Gonna do it...!

```
$ doit
```

Done did it.

### Running

The included `Procfile` will run the app server and the background worker.
`honcho`, a `Procfile` runner, is included as a dependency:

```
$ honcho start
```

The application server will listen on `http://127.0.0.1:42157`.
You'll want to use your favourite web server to proxy traffic to it.
<small>This author suggests Caddy.</small>

### Development

For development, you may want to use `Procfile.dev`, which starts flask in
debug mode and rebuilds the static assets automatically when they change

```
$ honcho -f Procfile.dev start
```

Or you could just look at `Procfile.dev` and run those things manually. It's up
to you.

You can run the (currently very incomplete) test suite by running `pytest`.
You'll need redis installed on your development machine, a temporary redis
server will be started and shut down automatically by the test suite.
